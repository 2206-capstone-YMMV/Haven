<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Haven is a unique utility app designed to serve the communities of those in need. The aim of the app is to lend a hand to those who may not have any other avenue for support. The app is supported by special helper users who are able to offer special services or create events for people to take advantage of. Haven allows users to share and access information about their local area with a variety of different tools making sure that no user feels the need to step too far out of their comfort zone to get the support they need.
